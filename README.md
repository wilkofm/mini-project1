Max's Movie Corner Mini Project

# Project Outline

What Do I Want To Make?

Max’s Movie Corner, is a one-page site where the user receives a card list of movies with information such as movie title, year, director etc. and they can filter the movies based on genre, year or rating. The movie cards are also clickable, linking to trailers of each movie.

# Github

How many branches and what for?

Main Branch

- This is my production-ready branch. It should always contain stable, tested code

Card-List Branch

- Where I set up the initial card list that pulls the list of movies from my API

Feature/Filter Branch

- Branch where I create the ability to filter each film based on the movie genre, year or rating.
- This is also where I create the ability to have each movie link to a specific film trailer

Styling Branch

- Branch where I style and make everything look aesthetically pleasing

# Styling Goals

I want the site to have a minimal feel, a clean, art gallery/Mubi/Letterboxd aesthetic

Here are a few styling features I’d like to implement:

- Interesting Font
- Icons
- Flex-Box To Style Page and Card-list, create a navbar to house filter options
- Resizing card/images so everything is uniform
- Clean layout

# How To Implement This Project Yourself

- Import the HTML, CSS, JS and JSON files into your development environment
- Fill in the JSON file with your nominated films, and links to their related trailers
- Store your film posters in a seperate 'images' folder
