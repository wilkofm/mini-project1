Max's Movie Corner Mini Project

# Project Outline

What Do I Want To Make?

Max’s Movie Corner, is a one-page site where the user receives a card list of movies with information such as movie title, year, director etc. and they can filter the movies based on genre, year or rating.

# Github

How many branches and what for?

Main Branch

- This is my production-ready branch. It should always contain stable, tested code

Card-List Branch

- Where I set up the initial card list that pulls the list of movies from the API

Feature/Filter Branch

- Branch where I create the ability to filter each film based on the movie genre, year or rating.

Styling Branch

- Branch where I style and make everything look aesthetically pleasing

Back End Link

- Branch where I link everything to a backend server

# Styling Ideas

I want the site to have a minimal feel, immaculate, art gallery/Mubi aesthetic

Here are a few styling features I’d like to implement:

- Interesting Font
- Icons
- Flex-Box To Style Page and Card-list, create a breaker on the left-hand side

# Questions I Have

Where do I source my movie data API?

How do I create the rating feature?

How Do I create the ability to rate films based on the rating?

How to link the backend to the rest?
